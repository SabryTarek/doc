# Defination
 Usenet can be defined as a network where people exchange news.
# History
Usenet was created by two graduate students of Duke University in North Carolina, Jim Ellis and Tom Truscott worked on their idea of connecting different computers to exchange information within the UNIX community, and thus created a network that allowed the exchange of information and served as a bulletin-board.

It began as a small, restricted communication network between some of the universities in the United States. It was used for news, trade information and research results. Over the last 3 decades, Usenet has evolved considerably and has grown from a simple restricted communication network to a well-structured logical network connecting hundreds of millions of people and computers to 100,000 and more newsgroups and millions of articles.

A newsgroups can be either moderated or unmoderated. In moderated newsgroups, all posts must be approved by a moderator first if the user wants to become a part of the discussion. In unmoderated group, there is no restriction of any sort, and everything posted by users becomes part of the discussion. Some of the newsgroups also use bots to moderate the content. These bots can automatically eliminate posts that are deemed as offensive or off topic.

# Some newsgroups have individuals who act as administrators and moderators. They ensure that content posted is relevant to the newsgroup topics and eliminate inflammatory content.
