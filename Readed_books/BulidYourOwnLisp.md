For people feeling more confident a program called gdb can be used to debug your C programs. This can be difficult and complicated to use, but it is also very powerful and can give you extremely valuable information and what went wrong and where. Information on how to use gdb can be found online.

On Mac the most recent versions of OS X don't come with gdb. Instead you can use lldb which does largely the same job.

On Linux or Mac valgrind can be used to aid the debugging of memory leaks and other more nasty errors. Valgrind is a tool that can save you hours, or even days, of debugging. It does not take much to get proficient at it, so investigating it is highly recommended. Information on how to use it can be found online.
