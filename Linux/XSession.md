If you ever stuck at the linux console (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and need to view some graphic related content like video or picture
then the framebuffer allows this to be possible.
Just make sure to add yourself to the video group.
To get back to the Xsession GUI is (Ctrl+Alt+F7)



XSession = GUI

terminal === console === virtual terminal
TTY


C-M-[1-6] -> TTY === virtual terminal === terminal emulator
C-M-[7-12] -> GUI === X Sessions

# blank TTY reserved for X Session only



Archlinux doesn't have GUI because it's a minimal Distro so you should install your GUI by yourself
TLDP = The Linux Documentation Project tldp.org

~/.config/autostart/

ssh -C -c bluefish-cbc,arcfour<user@hostname>



ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings. It provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy. It ships with "rifle", a file launcher that is good at automatically finding out which program to use for what file type.
