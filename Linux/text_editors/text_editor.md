> vi, vim

The granddaddy of Unix text editors, vi, is infamous for its difficult, non-intuitive command structure. On the bright side, vi is powerful, lightweight, and fast. Learning vi is a Unix rite of passage, since it is universally available on Unix-like systems. On most Linux distributions, an enhanced version of the traditional vi editor called vim is used.


> Emacs

The true giant in the world of text editors is Emacs by Richard Stallman. Emacs contains (or can be made to contain) every feature ever conceived for a text editor. It should be noted that vi and Emacs fans fight bitter religious wars over which is better.



> nano ->  pico

nano is a free clone of the text editor supplied with the pine email program. nano is very easy to use but is very short on features. I recommend nano for first-time users who need a command line editor.



> gedit

gedit is the editor supplied with the Gnome desktop environment.



> kwrite

kwrite is the "advanced editor" supplied with KDE. It has syntax highlighting, a helpful feature for programmers and script writers.
