[Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9)
==============================

Plan 9 from Bell Labs:
- distributed operating system
- originating in the Computing Sciences Research Center (CSRC) at Bell Labs in the mid-1980s
- building on UNIX concepts
- first developed there in the late 1960s and The final official release was in early 2015


- Under Plan 9, UNIX's "everything is a file" metaphor was to be extended via a pervasive network-centric filesystem, and graphical user interface assumed as a basis for almost all functionality, though retaining a heavily text-centric ideology

- The name Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a reference to the Ed Wood 1959 cult science fiction Z-movie Plan 9 from Outer Space.[5] Also, Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny, is presumably a reference to Wood's film Glen or Glenda. The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.[6][7]







- Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny, mascot of Plan 9 by Bell.
- Installation of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, GUI mode, 640x480x8 colour mode.
- 
- Plan 9 replaced Unix as Bell Labs's primary platform for operating systems research.


- Fossil is the default file system in Plan 9 from Bell Labs.


- 9front seems to be one of the few forks that is still under active development. Though to be honest, I can't really think of any practical application of it except maybe toying with a new release in a virtual machine.

=========
- 
i still maintain a cluster of RPI3 running plan9's cpu/file servers, mostly for playground and backups, but also for my ~, i don't trust unix file system, so what i care i just store in p9 fossil.
what i miss from plan9 is its completely decentralized environment, i never understood why cpus, disks, memories and screens are glued together, what is networking for? all those lessons we learned in the 80s and 90s are forgotten, nowadays it looks like networking is just meant for making http requests




OpenBSD
=======
>> Have you looked through the C code in FreeBSD's analogous utilities for the kind of bloat or lack of it?  If so, what opinions did you come to?
> I'm confident that BSD code is way WAAAAYYY better that GNU bloatware.
>>> FreeBSD is shit, repos are shit. It's just shit. In fact it's so bad when I tried it they told me to use OpenBSD.

>> What are your selling points of OpenBSD?

>>> Code quality is awesome (part of why OpenBSD is so secure), if there is a package in the repo it works period. They won't half ass something just say they did it, that will get your ass handed to you. It is small as hell and is as close to Plan9 as you'll get without using 9front. It is so amazing I can't even begin to explain it. I am a computer egineering student and OpenBSD is my favorite OS for everything. It works, it's secure and it's not half assed. Unlike Linux, OpenBSD cares about one thing code quality. It doesn't matter where you are from, who you are or what politics you have, when you are in OpenBSD you are just in OpenBSD nothing else. It's awesome!
>> Thanks for that. I'll probably start with a VM soon.
