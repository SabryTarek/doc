Once you unlock the bootloader you can get a custom recovery such as TWRP load it to Ram without affecting any of the partitions. From there you can use TWRP to make backups of your partitions, or I will show you a way through ADB to pull partitions as images directly to your desktop computer.



I am looking for a solution to send a link from Android via https POST to a server and save it in a database. The same should be possible via chromium and via a simple web interface i would like to be able to edit the link list. I would like to take link from the clipboard encrypt it via gpg and send it to the server through a tls tunnel. This way i would like to replace pocket. Do you have any tips on how to do that?




unlocking its bootloader putting a custom recovery on there pull back up the images modifying the images throwing them back on the phone and getting some shell scripts running on there


unlocking a phone can mean two things.
1) Unlocking it so you can use it on more than one carrier (ATT, T-Mobile, etc).
2) Unlocking the bootloader.

We are going to focus on #2.  On most desktop top computers you can boot and install whatever OS you want,  Windows, Linux, BSD, etc.  On Phones and Tablets you can't, mainly because the boot loader is locked.  Once unlocked you can boot whatever you want (that is available).  Although it voids the warranty on most devices, once the bootloader is unlocked, you have control to boot your own recovery or mod of android. Basically there is nothing from stopping you from doing whatever you want on the phone, including rooting it, which is just getting root/admin control of your phone. There is always a root/admin account on a device.  It's either you, or it's someone else.  Best make it you.
