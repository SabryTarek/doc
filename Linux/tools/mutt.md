- y -> change

- d-> $ -> y
- r ->replay at email

I'm searching for am mail program which store each single mail in an extra file. Prefered *.eml So I can have documentation of my company corespontenz. Which one is the best one?﻿

How do I get a transparent background, all my other terminal apps conform to the terminals default background colour﻿


you need a compositor like compiz, compton ...etc﻿



screenkey﻿ cli program -> show what you write on keyboard



what the difference is between imap and smtp ?
POP3




Note for people using GMail. You can actually add Note for people usin +anything on your email address and still receive emails. For example, if your email is something@gmail.com and you write your email like this something+stupid_site@gmail.com it will still work. Difference is, now when you get spam you know which site betrayed your trust and can easily filter that.﻿



@Mladen Mijatov hehe yea i use that trick to signup for multiple free stuff; but some sites are very poor and doesnt allow + signs or periods in email field so using gmail aliases wont work. Usually i would just use http://10minutemail.com/ if i know is spam already﻿


Hey m8, do you think you could help me set one of these up for  a  POP3 riseup email?

https://riseup.net/en/email/clients

I can't get it to work. a IMAP is fine, too.

Also, I have an email going through 7chan.org that I can't getting logging in either. It's a work group on google, but, it doesn't work trafficking through the gmail smtp.

nvm, I got the riseup email working, but, I still can't get my 7chan account working﻿







Can you integrate Gmail contacts into mutt? Thanks.﻿Can you int

think theres a program called goobook for gmail contacts. I mainly use abook for addressbook









A) how I can set up my terminal to have a similar color scheme to yours (i.e. is it a downloadable theme of sorts?) and B) how were you able to customize the layout of tmux info at the bottom of the screen (i.e. centered window tabs)?﻿

+Orrin Ahola (A) I&#39;m using zsh shell, i usually use guake or gnome-terminal as drop-down terminal, it has the &quot;tango&quot; color by default i believe, with &quot;monospace&quot; fonts. (B) heres my tmux.conf https://github.com/gotbletu/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/.tmux.conf#L236﻿





unrelated to mutt...
Man you should check out SpaceFM during 2016, I think you are a thunar user, but its really worth to check out﻿



+EmperorTerran oh whats the advantages or differences with that?﻿



+gotbletu the layout approach of four swithes, which feels like tilling like, general UI customization while maintaining speed of pcmanFM. Love the customization of how to open stuff thats in sidebar. Abbility to show really really large thumbnails of images...  and generally it feels like it has own feel to it, while I have trouble on first glance telling thunar, nautilus, files apart﻿

instead of imap server

never tried mutt but pine mail reader is great - used it from 97-02 and still miss it now (life' to short to run pop3/imap client in 2018).﻿

I use Devuan ASCII XFCE4, I had to install “pulseaudio” and “pavucontrol” for audio in Firefox and Steam. ;(﻿

Hello Bean6754! You can use JACK instead: http://www.zamaudio.com/?p=1580
Otherwise you could install falkon perhaps in a VM with Calculate Linux XFCE if Devuan is unable to provide you Falkon. In Calculate Linux Falkon is installed in less than one minute!!!
Calculate Linux is systemd free, is a rock solid rolling release. The French dev of Calculate uses it since 2012 without any major issue!
If you need some help you can contact me. 
Best regards﻿
