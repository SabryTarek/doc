pacman
======


one of the major distinguishing features of Arch Linux.
Combines a simple binary package format with an easy-to-use build system.
The goal of pacman is to make it possible to easily manage packages, whether they are from the official repositories or the user's own builds.


Pacman keeps the system up to date by synchronizing package lists with the master server.

Pacman is written in the C programming language and uses the bsdtar(1) tar format for packaging.

 Being able to repair a borked kernel upgrade by booting from an old Ubuntu stick, chrooting into the Arch system installed on the disk, and running pacman from inside there - that gave me really good cross-compatibility warmfuzzies. :D
