xbps
====

- XBPS Stands for "X Binary Package System" , x not stand for Xorg but for eXtreme
- void linux
- originally written for it but it's supposed to be also a portable package manager you could theoretically use somewhere else I don't know of any other districts that use it yet

- void Linux only has free software and I actually like that I like that there's a division between free software and non-free software if you want to install non-free software you need to install an extra-extra repository



- also see that there's also a multi Lib repository if you want 32-bit you know packages or something like that or 32-bit and on free packages all that kind of stuff is there so I will go ahead and say

xbps is devided to: 
- xbps-install
- xbps-remove
- xbps-query
- xbps-src AUR equviant



sudo in linux === doas in bsd

- ls
- lsusb
- lsblk
