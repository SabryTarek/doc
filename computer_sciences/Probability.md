# The Central Limit Theorem => Means are normaly distributed



we can use the means normal distribution to make confidence intervals
Do T-tests where we ask if there's a difference between the means from two samples
in ANOVA where we ask if there is a difference among the means from three or more samples
and pretty much any statistical test that uses the





For the people looking for the statement of the Central Limit Theorem here it is:
"CLT states that probability distribution governing Yn(bar) (Mean of Yn) approaches a Normal Distribution as n tends to infinity regardless of the probability distribution governing the independent random variables Yi"

And here is the explanation:
Consider n random independent variables Yi = Y1, Y2...Yn with a random probability distribution. With a view of calculating the mean(mu) of this, calculate the sample mean that is Yn(bar). Now as n-->infinity, 
                            (Yn(bar) - Mu) / (sigma/root of n) 
approaches a normal distribution. Furthermore, the mean of the distribution governing Yn(bar) [The right side graph in the video] approaches mu and the standard deviation approaches (sigma/root of n).ï»¿



Cauchy Distribution in mostly in physics related fields.I have seen it's use in Satelite design









 factorial design??

Have you seen the linear models StatQuests? Factorial design is a type of linear model. If you have time, watch those - they'll get you 80% of the way there - there are few extra details (like how to check for interactions and what not) that I don't cover - but the main ideas are all there. Here are the links:
Linear Regression: https://youtu.be/nk2CQITm_eo
Multiple Regression: https://youtu.be/zITIFTsivN8
t-tests and ANOVA: https://youtu.be/NF5_btOaCig
Design Matrices: https://youtu.be/2UYx-qjJGSs
That last video (which builds on all the previous ones, is the most important thing. If you understand design matrices, you're just a step away from factorial design.

Statistical Model: -> a way to explore relation between/among things -> linear/nonlinear/exponential/log,
Mathmatical Model: Equation






 I really like your expression about "model is a relationship".  Just want to add a bit of my point of view.  To me, statistical model is a relationship derived from examining the data using statistical theories.  The relationships from these models usually can not derive from a physical law.  Whether or not the relationship is linear/nonlinear/exponential/log, they are all pure speculations based on data.  There are also physical models, such as modeling the speed of a car according to its weight. These are also models but the relationships are derived from the physical laws (in this case, Newton).  Also in engineering, there are lots of empirical models, where the relationships ranges from non-physical to semi-physical, such as Manning's equation.  Part of the model can be explained by physics, but part of it is not.
