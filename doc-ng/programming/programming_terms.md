Programming Terms:
- language agnostic: 
- Memoization: a technique of caching results of expensive function calls in order to speed up computer programs when the same input occurs again

auto Memoization
- String Interpolation = string formatting: the process of evaluating a string containing one or more placeholders and yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values

# Good for start. We can also bind the placeholders with their values via indexes of values. Nevertheless, i like your explanation!



- Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

idempotent element


- combination & permutation
Combinations are groups of values where order does not matter. Permutations are groups of values where order does matter


 a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns[1], replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
 hey our codebase is a mess and the
first thing I want you to do is to make
this code dry so if he tells you that
what that means is don't repeat yourself
