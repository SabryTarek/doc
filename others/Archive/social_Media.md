> Open Source Distributed Decentralized Social Networks: (Federated Networks)

- Mastodon aka Twitter alternative
  - fork of GNU Social but done right
  - uses Ruby with postgres
- friendica aka Twitter alternative (http://friendica.com/)
- [Diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org/)



we've had federated networks since the beganning of the Internet

**email** is the oldest and most used federated network
you have an email server over here let's call it Gmail and you have a email server over here let's call it Yahoo they can talk to one another because:
  - they are a federated network
  - they use the same protocol and that protocol is compatible across the board this is an introduction to **Activitypub**

activitypub like the glue that connects everything

networks uses activitypub

it's too bad JSON-LD is extremely slow

the really interesting thing about matrix is it has this idea of gateways.
gateways: are sort of you know exactly what they sound they're bridges that allow you to go ahead and talk to people on a different protocols.
 so for example you can go ahead and use one of the clients
  and there's a whole bunch of different clients for for matrix
   there's also a whole bunch of different servers for matrix
    and you can run this locally on your own system and have your own chat server that then integrates with other chat servers so it's decentralized
     you don't have to necessarily be using Google servers you can use your own and still be able to talk to people outside of the folks logged on to your particular server or your particular service right
      so there's a number different clients but the the client that is sort of the most commonly used one at least that I've seen is riot
       so riot is sort of a kind of traditional you know browser-based kind of you know it runs as an application but it's one of those Chrome based apps that you can go ahead and use I forget the name of that off the top my head but basically it sorta like the Firefox toolkit and same thing for Chrome and it's got a you know a local version that you can go run on your desktop it's
        also get one that you can go run on your phone
         it supports group chatting like like a Skype like a discord like a slack and it also has a VoIP and video calling so you can go ahead and do video calling much like with a Google you know um hangouts I said they're calling them now you can do that you know from a browser you can do that from the app
          and I think this is a really interesting idea because again it's not tied to a particular corporation
           so I guess I don't have the ffmpeg or things like that installed on this on this machine but the idea is you can go ahead and see you know how this could be very very useful especially as I talked about in my previous video if you're somebody like me who is getting a little bit concerned about how monolithic the tech space is you know there's there's Facebook and there's Google and they own a lot of stuff at this point so you know I don't necessarily want my communications to go through a company I you know I don't see the need for this I I like the idea of protocols I like the idea of open source I like the idea of peer-to-peer stuff because that's what the internet was built for that's was the whole idea you know you look at you know even even if you assume that a company like Google or a company like Facebook has the best of intentions they are you know as their their motto used to be for Google a company that is it going to do no evil











Matrix is a very cool distributed, encrypted, peer-to-peer instant messaging system which supports voice, and video chat. It's similar to the idea of jabber, an open chat protocol, but with modern communication in mind.








and basically what it's doing is spoofing sort of an IRC account
 so it's creating an IRC account and as proxying anything that I send over there and it's doing the same thing in return
  so now I'm you know able to be on IRC
   you could do the same kind of thing for you know a whole bunch of different protocols that they support and if we go close this and go back to the Firefox kind of instance where we had this up we can go back to the gateways or bridge networks as they call them so they've got a bunch of different bridge networks again it looks like that was supposed to be video but this allows us to go communicate with other platforms and protocols and that's a really useful thing and that's going to be encrypted end-to-end so I think this is pretty interesting




IRC Gateway (plugin)

bridge networks

freenode one of the most popular IRC [channel - server - network]
