* DROW = tie

- STALEMATE
- insufficient material
- DRAW AGREEMENT
- 50 MOVE RULE. This states that if both sides make 50 moves in a row with no captures or pawn moves, the game is a draw.
- The final way that a game can end in a draw is THREEFOLD REPETITION. This means the same exact position is reached three times, with the same person to move. The most common way that this happens is called PERPETUAL CHECK. This means one side keeps checking the other side over and over again, and there is no way to escape. Let's look at an example.

* special move:

- CASTLING: you can only use once during a game. When you castle, you move your king two squares toward your rook, and then your rook jumps over your king and lands next to it on the other side! You can only do it if your king and rook haven't moved yet, and only if there are no other pieces in the way.
three special castling rules. First, you can't castle "out of check" (you can't castle when you're in check), "through check" (you can't castle if your king would be moving through a square where it's in check), or "into check" (you can't castle if your king would end up in check at the end).

- in passing: There is a special pawn move called "en passant", which is French for "in passing". It involves a pawn capturing another pawn which has just moved two squares forward. Remember, this move is only possible right after your opponent moves his pawn two squares forward, and your pawn is directly next to it.

- pawn promotion: Now we're going to learn about the most important special pawn move, called "pawn promotion". If your pawn reaches the end of the board, it becomes a queen, rook, bishop, or knight! You simply move your pawn to the last rank and replace it with whatever piece you want (except for a king). This means that every little pawn is important, because it may eventually become a much more powerful piece!




- Now we're going to learn about one of the most important rules in chess: CHECK. Check is when the king is under attack, and can be captured on the next move. If your king is in check, you MUST get out of check immediately. You can do this in one of three ways: you can MOVE your king to a square where it isn't in check, you can BLOCK the check by moving a piece in between your king and the checking piece, or you can CAPTURE the piece that is putting you in check.

Reading Chess Analysis
+/- (4.52) # 4.52 pawns 
positive is white up, and negative is black up. but That also can depend on the chess engine.  I understand some engines use a positive evaluation meaning the current player (white or black) is up, and negative meaning the current player is down.



According to DecodeChess, Qa1 is recommended because it:
- removes the queen from an unsupported square.
