Diaspora is free software both in the “gratis” and the “libre” 

And of course, MongoDB is an atypical choice for data storage. The vast majority of Rails applications are backed by PostgreSQL or (less often these days) MySQL.

social network === undirected grap


For quite a few years now, the received wisdom has been that social data is not relational, and that if you store it in a relational database, you’re doing it wrong.
But what are the alternatives? Some folks say graph databases are more natural, but I’m not going to cover those here, since graph databases are too niche to be put into production. Other folks say that document databases are perfect for social data, and those are mainstream enough to actually be used. So let’s look at why people think social data fits more naturally in MongoDB than in PostgreSQL.

All of the data we need for a TV show is under one document, so it’s very fast to retrieve all this information at once, even if the document is very large. There’s a TV show here in the US called “General Hospital” that has aired over 12,000 episodes over the course of 50+ seasons. On my laptop, PostgreSQL takes about a minute to get denormalized data for 12,000 episodes, while retrieval of the equivalent document by ID in MongoDB takes a fraction of a second.
So in many ways, this application presented the ideal use case for a document store.

Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute bytecode for interpreted languages. Parrot is designed for dynamic languages. Parrot is a target of variety of languages like Perl, Tcl, Ruby, Python, etc. In this tutorial, we shall learn using Parrot for Perl compiler. In this tutorial, we shall learn using Parrot for Perl compiler.
Parrot is going to change the way you see PERL!

When we feed our program into conventional Perl, it is first compiled into an internal representation, or bytecode; this bytecode is then fed into almost separate subsystem inside Perl to be interpreted. So there are two distinct phases of Perl's operation:

Compilation to bytecode and

Interpretation of bytecode.

This is not unique to Perl. Other languages following this design include Python, Ruby, Tcl and even Java.

We also know that there is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is a platform independent execution environment that converts Java bytecode into machine language and executes it. If you understand this concept then you will understand Parrot.

Parrot has been written using most popular language "C".



> basic building blocks in most programming languages


f the condition isn’t a bool, we’ll get an error. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs


fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}


 Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide if with a Boolean as its condition.

index out of range
index out of bound

numbers by themselves are also expressions

One of the uses of a loop is to retry an operation you know can fail, such as checking if a thread completed its job

    assert_eq!(result, 20);
