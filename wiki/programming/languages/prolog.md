prolog ([Pro]gramming in [log]ic)
=================================
breef:-


prolog is just quite simply a collection of facts and rules that we can query.
 and Prolog is going to focus on describing facts and relationships about problems rather than creating a series of steps to solve that problem like you might see in another programming language.
  and these facts and rules are going to be stored in a file called either the database or knowledgebase
