Web Service VS API
==============

Difference between Web Service and API
1. WebService always need network for its operations but API may or may not need network for its operations
2. Webservice can be ued by following communication : Soap, Rest, XML RPC 
but API can be communicated through other ways like CURL calls
3. API can also be exposed in number of ways like JAR, DLL, XML over Http, Json over Http etc
4.  All Webservice can be consider as API but all API are not Web Service



Web services are of two kinds: 
- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
- Representational State Transfer (REST)
SOAP defines a standard communication protocol (set of rules) specification for XML-based message exchange. SOAP uses different transport protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP.
